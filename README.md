# Edge-AI Smart Voice Assistant  

## Day 1: Project Setup  

> A well-structured start prevents unnecessary struggles later. Build strong foundations first.

### Why This Step?  

A well-organized project structure and essential installations ensure smooth development throughout the journey.  

### Tasks Completed  
- Installed required libraries (`numpy`, `pandas`, `speechrecognition`, `librosa`, etc.).  
- Created the project directory with organized folders:  
- Verified library installations in **VS Code**.

## Day 2: Python Fundamentals for AI Development

> Great AI begins with simple logicâ€”master the basics before the magic.

### Why This Step?

Strong Python skills ensure efficient coding when implementing AI models. Understanding Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) helps in structuring AI systems efficiently.

### Tasks Completed

Reviewed Python basics:
- Variables, Loops, Functions
- List & Dictionary Comprehensions
- Exception Handling
- Explored Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts

## Day 3: Introduction to NumPy for Data Processing

> Data is the fuel of AI; learning NumPy is knowing how to refine it.

### Why This Step?

NumPy is essential for numerical computing, matrix operations, and handling large datasets efficiently. In AI, it forms the backbone of data processing before training models.

### Tasks to Complete

- Learn NumPy basics: Arrays, indexing, broadcasting
- Perform matrix operations for AI data preprocessing
- Work with NumPy for numerical computations

## Day 4: Data Manipulation with Pandas
 > A well-structured dataset is the foundation of any AI model.
### Why This Step?

Pandas is essential for handling structured data, cleaning datasets, and preparing them for AI models.

Tasks Completed

- Learned how to read, manipulate, and clean datasets.
- Performed basic filtering, grouping, and transformations.
- Saved and loaded datasets efficiently.
